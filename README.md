# Eurostat Digital Landscape Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of internet access and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector development across European countries.
The project explores the relationship between household internet access and employment in the ICT sector using Eurostat data from 2012 to 2021.

## Data Sources

## Key Findings

### Trends (2012-2021)
- **Internet Access**: Increased by 19.6 percentage points (27.6% growth)
  - Mean internet access rose from 71.0% to 90.6%
- **ICT Employment**: Grew by 1 percentage point (40% growth)
  - Mean ICT employment increased from 2.5% to 3.5%

### Correlation
- Moderate positive correlation (r = 0.55) between internet access and ICT employment
- Correlation is not uniform across all countries

## Highlighted Country Analyses

### Austria
- Steady increases in internet access and ICT employment
- Consistently below the regression line

### Bulgaria
- Low internet access but high ICT employment
- Known as the "Silicon Valley" of the Eastern Bloc

### Estonia
- Rapid digital transformation
- Started with low internet access
- Achieved second-highest ICT employment rate by 2021

### Greece
- Improved internet access
- Stagnant ICT employment rates

## Methodology
- **Data Tool**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Analysis Period**: 9 years (2012-2021)
- **Countries Analyzed**: 18 European countries

## Limitations
- Some data gaps due to decentralized data collection
- Certain countries excluded from analysis
- Potential bias in data representation

## Policy Implications
- Holistic approach needed for ICT sector development
- Internet access alone is not sufficient for ICT employment growth
- Opportunities for future job creation in the digital sector
